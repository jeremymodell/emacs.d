This directory contains the obsolete libraries for exporting .org
files to various formats.

It is kept here for archiving purpose and to ease the reading of the
source code, in case it helps with users migrating to the new export
engine.

If you want to use the old exporters, you should checkout the maint
branch of Org's repository and reload Org.
